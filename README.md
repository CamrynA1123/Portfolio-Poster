# Portfolio Poster

To complete a research poster assignment for my Data Analysis course, I decided to research how foreign development aid impacts maternal deaths in Nigeria. Nigeria accounted for more than a quarter of the world's maternal deaths in 2019 and 2020, also representing the most maternal deaths in sub-Saharan Africa. To examine this question, I utilized World Bank (WB) "Nigeria - Net Official Development Assistance And Official Aid Received" data on its aid to Nigeria between the years 2000 and 2020, as well as the World Health Organization's (WHO) 2023 report, "Trends in maternal mortality 2000 to 2020 estimates by WHO, UNICEF, UNFPA, World Bank Group and UNDESA/Population Division", on global maternal deaths (isolating Nigeria's maternal deaths) between the same time period. Despite expecting more WB aid to decrease maternal deaths in Nigeria, the project's results depict a positive relationship between WB aid and Nigeria's maternal deaths. This result is explained further in the "Results" section of the poster and is supported by a regression table and linear fit graph. 

Within this repository, you may access the one-page poster, both the WB aid and WHO maternal deaths CSV data files, and the replication Rmd file.
